# Pharmalogue
  - A pharmaceutical catalog system for the Pharmacy located in Iligan City called Botica Yscobel. There are three users including customer, clerk, and admin.
  - A final web development project created with my amazing team including Ms. Usha Cobrado, Ms. Noven Grace Regahal, and Ms. Nina Sacala. 
  - All of us act as front-end developers and back-end developers.
  - Aim:
    - present medical information on OTC drugs
    - act as an inventory system with its quantity update feature,
    - communicate with the pharmacy’s customers through its consultation feature,
    - edit and update medicine information, and (5) display a map of the pharmacy’s branches. All the functions are expected to bring ease to the pharmacy’s end as well as to promote collaboration between pharmacy staff. Furthermore, the specific pharmacy in collaboration with this project is Botica Ycsobel pharmacy located in Iligan City operating in seven (7) barangays in the city.
